# VectorCAST-execution
VectorCAST Jenkins integration.

This plugin adds a top-level menu item 'VectorCAST' for creating and managing VEctorCAST manage project jobs. It allows for single job creation that executes all environments in the manage project or multi-job to create a Jenkins job per environment to allow the jobs to be spread across multiple nodes.

Coverage is displayed using the VectorCAST-coverage plugin (which is based on Emma).
